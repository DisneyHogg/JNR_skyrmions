This code uses the work of Josh Cork, Linden Disney-Hogg, Derek Harland, and Paul Sutcliffe, to provide an implementation of JNR skyrmions for the Julia package Skyrmions3D by Chris Halcrow. 

In addition, the code provides methods to consider the positions and multiplicities of the JNR skyrmions. 

ToDO:

- Reduce the amount of repeated code between `make_JNR_full_quaternionic` and `make_JNR_pure_imaginary`. 
- Remove arbitrary (hyper)parameter decisions in `make_JNR` and `JNR_positions`. 
- Allow users to determine when `make_JNR` is verbose.
- Decide whether to raise a warning if `poles` and `weights` are provided which are of different size. 
- Write tests for functions. 
- Decide if keeping inputs being quaternions is sensible. 
- Add additional package depedencies (`Optim`, `IntervalArithmetic`, `IntervalRootFinding`, `ForwardDiff`, `LinearAlgebra`) to Skyrmions3D.jl? Only the first of these is required for the core make_JNR functionality.

# Assume in this definition mu is given

# methods associated to a given function name. 
function make_JNR!(skyrmion, poles, weights, mu)
"""
    make_JNR!(skyrmion, poles, weights, mu)
    
Writes an JNR skyrmion in to `skyrmion`. The JNR data is given by `poles` and `weights`, while an additional parameter of the method is `mu`. 

If no `mu` is given, the function will determine an appropriate value by optimising a loss function containing the energy of the skyrmion and a penalty term to ensure that the baryon number is close to the theoretically desired value. 

### Input

- `poles` -- array of Quaternions (from the `GLMakie` package) of size `B+1` for some integer `B`
- `weights` -- array of (positive) floats of size `B+1`
- `mu` -- positive float

### Output

Acts on `skyrmion` to populate its pion field with that defined by the Harland-Sutcliffe approximation of the corresponding JNR data. 

### Examples (of data)
```
B = 1
weights = [1.0, 1.0]
poles = [Quaternion(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0) for a in 1:B+1]
poles[1] = Quaternion(2.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)
poles[2] = Quaternion(-2.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)
mu = sqrt(2.0)

B = 2
weights = [1.0, 1.0, 1.0]
poles = [Quaternion(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0) for a in 1:B+1]
poles[1] = Quaternion(2.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)
poles[2] = Quaternion(-1.0, sqrt(3.0), 0.0, 0.0)
poles[3] = Quaternion(-1.0, -sqrt(3.0), 0.0, 0.0)
mu = 2.0
```

### Notes

Here a JNR skyrmion refers to the approximation of a ADHM skyrmion field coming from JNR data defined by Paul Sutcliffe in JHEP12(2024)054, equation (2.5). That approximation uses the work of Sutcliffe-Harland.

In that paper Sutcliffe simplifies equation (2.5) for the Skyrme field in the case where all JNR poles are pure imaginary to equation (2.8), and this code uses this simplified formula in that case. 

At present the code quietly chooses whether to use the full quaternionic or the pure imaginary formula. It may be helpful in the future to allow one to choose this to happen out loud. 

What we call weights[i] is lambda_i^2.  

If `mu` is determined automatically, Optim.jl is used to find an appropriate value in the range [0.1, 10.0]. Future work may wish to determine is this is a suitable range to investigate over (the numerical examples from Cork-Disney-Hogg all find values in the range [1.0, 4.0]). In particular one can see if the Skyrmion does not predominantly lie close to the x4=0 plane then the Harland-Sutcliffe approximation becomes less accurate, and so the numerical Baryon number of the approximation is unlikely to be close to the true value. This means that the range for choosing `mu` is not particularly reasonable.

function JNR_positions(poles, weights; multiplicities=false)
"""
   JNR_positions(poles, weights)

Finds the the points where the Skyrme field of the JNR skyrmions determined by `poles` and `weights` is -1, under the assumption that all poles are pure imaginary. 

### Input

- `poles` -- array of  pure imaginary Quaternions (from the `GLMakie` package) of size `B+1` for some integer `B`
- `weights` -- array of (positive) floats of size `B+1`
- `multiplicities` -- (default: false) logical determining whether to provide the multiplicities of positions (when possible) 

### Output

- `positions` -- array of Point3f data giving the positions of the constituent skyrmions. NOT CORRECT RIGHT NOW FORMAT-WISE
- `signs` -- (only if `multiplicities==true`) array of floats taking values +-1.0 giving the sign of the corresponding constituent skyrmion. 

### Notes

Thinking of a skymrion as a collection of constituent 1-skyrmions and anti-1-skymrions we determine the position and signs of these constituents by where the skyrmion field is -1 and it's local winding number at that point. 

For JNR skyrmions with pure imaginary poles the locations of these constituent positions are found where a function zeta (defined in the Sutcliffe paper) is 0. This is what is tested to find the positions. 

IntervalRootFinding.jl is used to find all roots of zeta, and then removes any solutions which actually contain poles. Positions are then returned as midpoints of intervals. To improve performance the bounding box in which which to search shrunk by a small amount (at most 1E-8, chosen because of the default tolerance taken in IntervalRootFinding). If the positions were within 1e-8 of the poles this would cause errors which one must be alert to, but that would be true because of the root finding tolerance regardless. One might in the future all for this tolerance to be an optional argument. 

If `multiplicities` is true, then the method used to calculate signs is that form the Cork-Disney-Hogg conjecture. 

All this requires that the positions be generic, i.e. the local winding number is +-1. In the event that there are coincident positions the numerical position finding can give non-sensical results, and the method for finding the multiplicity will not work. As an example of when this can fail, consider the B=2 case of equal weights where the poles form an equilateral triangle. 

In future this method could perhaps be improved by using the convex hull of the poles as the constraints, rather than just the bounding box. 

At present this function can be inefficient when positions are close together, with profiling suggesting that the root-finding procedure is the slow part. Future work could perhaps improve the running of this. 

In the case that B=1 and B=2 exact methods for finding the positions are known, and these could be implemented as special cases in the future.

"""
    plot_JNR_positions(poles, weights)

Plot the positions of the poles and the skyrmion centres associated to JNR data of `poles` and `weights`. 

### Input

- `poles` -- array of  pure imaginary Quaternions (from the `GLMakie` package) of size `B+1` for some integer `B`
- `weights` -- array of (positive) floats of size `B+1`
- `multiplicities` -- (default: false) logical determining whether to provide the multiplicities of positions (when possible) 
- `with_skyrmion` -- (default: nothing) if a skyrmion is given, its baryon density plot is provided on the same axes as the positions. 

### Output

- `fig` -- A figure showing the JNR positions using Makie.meshscatter. If `multiplicities==true` then the constituent positions are coloured based upon their sign. 

### Notes

To compute the positions and their signs `JNR_positions` is used, and the details of that function may be seen in its own documentation. 

The skyrmion baryon density could obscure positions, and so one should be alert to this. A simple example of this is with the B=1 JNR skyrmion. 

Another method for viewing the positions could just be to plot the isosurfaces of the relevant skyrmion field component. This is essentially using the existing method `plot_field`, namely something along the lines of `plot_field(skyrmion, component=4, iso_value=-0.99)`. Unforuntately at present this does not appear to work well.
